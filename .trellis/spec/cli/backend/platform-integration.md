# Platform Integration Guide

How to add support for a new AI CLI platform. The two currently registered are Claude Code and Codex — `PLATFORM_IDS` in `configurators/index.ts` is the list that counts.

---

## Architecture

Platform support uses a **centralized registry pattern** (similar to Turborepo's package manager support):

- **Data registry**: `src/types/ai-tools.ts` — `AI_TOOLS` record with all platform metadata
- **Function registry**: `src/configurators/index.ts` — `PLATFORM_FUNCTIONS`, one line per platform. It holds no per-platform logic; the doc-comment at `index.ts:1-11` is the authoritative add-a-platform list
- **Shared configurator utilities**: `src/configurators/shared.ts` — renderers (`resolvePlaceholders()`, `resolvePlaceholdersNeutral()`), resolvers (`resolveCommands()`, `resolveSkills()`, `resolveAllAsSkills()`, `resolveBundledSkills()`), map builders (`collectSkillTemplates()`, `collectBothTemplates()`, `collectSharedHooks()`), and the render/write pair (`renderTemplateMap()`, `writeTemplateMap()`). See `configurator-shared.md`
- **Shared template utilities**: `src/templates/template-utils.ts` — `createTemplateReader()` factory that eliminates boilerplate across platform template modules
- **Shared hooks**: `src/templates/shared-hooks/` — platform-independent Python hook scripts (session-start, inject-workflow-state, inject-subagent-context, inject-spec-context) written as-is to platform hook directories according to `SHARED_HOOKS_BY_PLATFORM`. Claude Code `statusLine` is not installed by default.
- **Common templates**: `src/templates/common/` — single source of truth for commands (start, finish-work), single-file workflow skills (before-dev, brainstorm, check, break-loop, update-spec), and multi-file bundled skills (trellis-channel, trellis-meta, trellis-session-insight, trellis-spec-bootstrap) with `{{placeholder}}` resolution per platform
- **Shared utilities**: `src/utils/compare-versions.ts` — `compareVersions()` with full prerelease support (used by cli, update, migrations)
- **Derived helpers**: `ALL_MANAGED_DIRS`, `getConfiguredPlatforms()`, etc. — consumed by update, init, hash tracking

All lists (backup dirs, template dirs, platform detection, cleanup whitelist) are **derived from the registry automatically**. No scattered hardcoded lists.

## Checklist: Adding a New Platform

When adding a new platform `{platform}`, update the following:

### Step 1: Type Definitions (data registry)

| File                    | Change                                                                                                  |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/types/ai-tools.ts` | Add to `AITool` union type                                                                              |
| `src/types/ai-tools.ts` | Add to `CliFlag` union type                                                                             |
| `src/types/ai-tools.ts` | Add to `TemplateDir` union type                                                                         |
| `src/types/ai-tools.ts` | Add entry to `AI_TOOLS` record (name, configDir, cliFlag, defaultChecked, hasPythonHooks, templateDirs) |

**This single entry automatically propagates to**: `BACKUP_DIRS`, `TEMPLATE_DIRS`, `getConfiguredPlatforms()`, `cleanupEmptyDirs()`, `initializeHashes()`, init `TOOLS[]` prompt, Windows detection.

### Step 2: CLI Flag

| File                   | Change                                                |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/cli/index.ts`     | Add `--{platform}` option                             |
| `src/commands/init.ts` | Add `{platform}?: boolean` to `InitOptions` interface |

> Note: Commander.js options and TypeScript interfaces require static declarations — cannot be derived from registry. A compile-time assertion `_AssertCliFlagsInOptions` in `init.ts` will catch missing `InitOptions` fields — you'll get a build error if `CliFlag` has a value not present in `InitOptions`.

### Step 3: Configurator (function registry)

| File                              | Change                                                                                         |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/configurators/{platform}.ts` | Create new configurator exporting **`collect{Platform}Templates(): Map<string, string>`**       |
| `src/configurators/index.ts`      | Add **`{platform}: fromTemplates(collect{Platform}Templates)`** to `PLATFORM_FUNCTIONS`         |

Do **not** write a `configure{Platform}` — `fromTemplates` derives it, so the
platform's file set is described exactly once and `trellis init` and `trellis
update` cannot disagree about it. Copy `configurators/codex.ts` as the shape —
`collectBothTemplates()` in `shared.ts` covers a platform that has both a
commands directory and a skills root in one call.

Both registered platforms spell both fields, each for a named residual:
claude-code (the `--with-statusline` flag) and codex (an intentionally empty
`.codex/skills/`). A residual is work that survives *after* the shared
writer and cannot be a path→content pair; it never adds a file. If your
platform seems to need one, read `configurator-shared.md` → "Template maps"
first — the parity oracle in `test/configurators/platforms.test.ts` will fail
the build if it is really just an extra write.

### Step 4: Templates

> **Key concept**: Platforms derive their content from `src/templates/common/` (commands + skills) via `resolvePlaceholders()` in `configurators/shared.ts`. Platform-specific template directories only contain **agents**, **settings/hooks config**, and platform-specific overrides. The `createTemplateReader()` factory from `src/templates/template-utils.ts` eliminates boilerplate in platform `index.ts` files.

**Claude Code pattern** (full hooks + agents + settings):

| Directory                            | Contents                                                     |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `src/templates/claude/`              | Root directory                                               |
| `src/templates/claude/index.ts`      | Export functions for agents, hooks, settings                 |
| `src/templates/claude/agents/`       | Agent definitions (`.md` files — implement, check, research) |
| `src/templates/claude/hooks/`        | Claude-specific hook scripts (`.py` files)                   |
| `src/templates/claude/settings.json` | Claude settings (uses `{{PYTHON_CMD}}` placeholder)          |

> Note: Claude Code is the reference platform. It has its own hooks directory (in addition to `shared-hooks/`) because a few Claude hooks have platform-specific integration points. Commands come from `src/templates/common/commands/`.

**Skills pattern** (Codex):

| Directory                         | Contents                                                                         |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/templates/codex/`            | Root directory                                                                   |
| `src/templates/codex/index.ts`    | Uses `createTemplateReader(import.meta.url)` — exports agents                    |
| `src/templates/codex/agents/`     | Agent definitions (`.toml`)                                                      |
| `src/templates/codex/hooks.json`  | Hook registration (SessionStart / UserPromptSubmit / SubagentStart / PreToolUse) |
| `src/templates/codex/hooks/`      | Codex-specific hook scripts                                                      |
| `src/templates/codex/config.toml` | Project-scoped Codex defaults                                                    |

> Note: Codex folds every shared template into a `SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter through `resolveAllAsSkillsNeutral()` (neutral because it writes into the shared `.agents/skills/` root), then `collectSkillTemplates(skillRoot, skills, bundledSkills)` folds the result into its template map. A platform that has both a commands directory and a skills root can use `collectBothTemplates(ctx, cmdPath, skillRoot)` in `shared.ts` instead, and adds its hook scripts with `collectSharedHooks(".{platform}/hooks", "{platform}")`.
>
> **Codex has a two-layer directory model:**
>
> | Layer                     | Install Path      | Template Source                           | Purpose                                                          |
> | ------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
> | Shared skills             | `.agents/skills/` | Generated from `common/` templates        | Cross-platform skills (agentskills.io standard)                  |
> | Codex config/agents/hooks | `.codex/`         | `src/templates/codex/{agents,hooks.json}` | Config, custom agents, hook config, and compatibility hook files |
>
> **Key rules:**
>
> - Shared skills in `.agents/skills/` must NOT contain platform-specific references (no `--platform codex`, no `codex exec`)
> - Agent TOML format: `name` + `description` + `developer_instructions` + optional `sandbox_mode` (NOT `[sandbox_read_only]` + `prompt`)
> - Codex hooks require `features.hooks = true` in user config (Codex 0.129+; older versions accept legacy `codex_hooks = true`); 0.129+ also gates per-hook activation behind a one-time `/hooks` TUI review
> - Platform detection uses `.codex/` only — `.agents/skills/` alone does NOT trigger codex detection
> - `configDir` is `".codex"`, with `supportsAgentSkills: true` to auto-include `.agents/skills` in managed paths

#### Rule: `.agents/skills/` writes use `resolvePlaceholdersNeutral()`

`.agents/skills/` is a **shared destination**: Codex writes it today, and any future agentskills.io consumer would write the same path. Per-platform `{{CMD_REF:name}}` resolution (`$name` for Codex, `/trellis:name` for a slash-command platform) would make the same `<skill>/SKILL.md` differ byte-for-byte depending on which configurator ran last → "last-writer-wins" content collisions and `.template-hashes.json` churn.

**Rule**: Anything written under `.agents/skills/` MUST be rendered via `resolvePlaceholdersNeutral()` (in `configurators/shared.ts`), which substitutes `` `name` (Trellis command) `` for `{{CMD_REF:name}}` instead of a platform prefix. All other placeholders (`{{CLI_FLAG}}`, `{{EXECUTOR_AI}}`, `{{USER_ACTION_LABEL}}`, conditionals, `{{PYTHON_CMD}}`) still resolve from the platform context — those don't appear in the auto-triggered skill templates from `common/skills/`, so the rendered output stays identical across writers.

Per-platform skill directories (`.claude/skills/`, etc.) keep using `resolvePlaceholders()` — `{{CMD_REF}}` resolves to the platform-correct slash form there, because no other configurator writes those paths.

**Command-as-skill fallback files under `.agents/skills/`** (currently `trellis-start/SKILL.md`, `trellis-continue/SKILL.md`, and `trellis-finish-work/SKILL.md`, written via `resolveAllAsSkillsNeutral()` by Codex) may use per-platform `{{CLI_FLAG}}` / `{{PYTHON_CMD}}` because they are user-invoked fallback entrypoints. They still go through the neutral helper to keep `{{CMD_REF}}` neutralized for consistency with the surrounding shared skills. A platform with its own private command and skill roots should not write `.agents/skills/` at all.

**Wrong**:

```typescript
// Codex configurator
files.set(".agents/skills/check/SKILL.md", resolvePlaceholders(tmpl, codexCtx));
// A second writer of the same shared root (later)
files.set(
  ".agents/skills/check/SKILL.md",
  resolvePlaceholders(tmpl, otherCtx),
);
// → byte-different SKILL.md from the same template; whoever runs last wins
```

**Correct**:

```typescript
files.set(
  ".agents/skills/check/SKILL.md",
  resolvePlaceholdersNeutral(tmpl, ctx),
);
// → byte-identical regardless of which configurator wrote it
```

**Required commands/skills**: Every platform must include the following (adapted to its own format). Content comes from `src/templates/common/`:

| Type    | Name          | Purpose                                                    | Required |
| ------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| Command | `start`       | Session initialization                                     | Yes      |
| Command | `finish-work` | Pre-commit checklist                                       | Yes      |
| Skill   | `before-dev`  | Read development guidelines (auto-discovers package specs) | Yes      |
| Skill   | `brainstorm`  | Requirements discovery                                     | Yes      |
| Skill   | `check`       | Check code quality (auto-discovers relevant specs)         | Yes      |
| Skill   | `break-loop`  | Post-debug analysis                                        | Yes      |
| Skill   | `update-spec` | Update code-spec docs                                      | Yes      |

> **Rule**: When a new command/single-file workflow skill is added, it is added to `src/templates/common/commands/` or `src/templates/common/skills/` — ALL platforms pick it up automatically via `resolveCommands()` / `resolveSkills()` / `resolveAllAsSkills()`. Check `src/templates/common/` as the reference source.

**Bundled built-in skills**: Multi-file skills with references/assets live under `src/templates/common/bundled-skills/<skill-name>/` and are installed through the same platform skill roots as workflow skills.

#### Scenario: Multi-file bundled skills

##### 1. Scope / Trigger

Use bundled skills when a built-in skill needs files beyond `SKILL.md`, such as `references/`, examples, or assets. Do not flatten large reference trees into `src/templates/common/skills/*.md`; single-file workflow skills stay there, while multi-file built-ins use `src/templates/common/bundled-skills/<skill-name>/`.

##### 2. Signatures

| Helper                                                    | Contract                                                                                               |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `getBundledSkillTemplates()`                              | Recursively reads `bundled-skills/*/` and returns POSIX relative file paths under each skill directory |
| `resolveBundledSkills(ctx)`                               | Resolves placeholders without adding frontmatter; bundled `SKILL.md` already owns frontmatter          |
| `collectSkillTemplates(skillRoot, skills, bundledSkills)` | Returns single-file workflow skills **and** bundled skill files as map entries under `skillRoot`       |

##### 3. Contracts

- Bundled skill source path: `src/templates/common/bundled-skills/<skill-name>/`.
- Bundled skill target path: `<platform-skill-root>/<skill-name>/<relative-file>`.
- `SKILL.md` inside a bundled skill owns its own YAML frontmatter; `wrapWithSkillFrontmatter()` must not be applied to bundled files.
- Relative file paths returned from the common template reader are POSIX-style, stable, and relative to the skill directory.
- `collectTemplates()` is the single description; `configure` writes it. Bundled skill files are covered by that guarantee automatically.

##### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition                                                            | Expected behavior                                                         |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Bundled skill directory is missing                                   | Return no bundled skills; single-file workflow skill generation continues |
| Bundled skill has nested references                                  | Preserve the nested relative path under every platform skill root         |
| Bundled `SKILL.md` contains placeholders                             | Resolve placeholders with the platform `TemplateContext`                  |
| Platform omits `bundledSkills` from its `collectSkillTemplates()` call | That platform silently ships none of them. The parity oracle cannot see this — both paths agree, they just agree on the wrong set — so `test/templates/<platform>.test.ts` has to assert one bundled file by name |
| Bundled file path uses OS-specific separators                        | Normalize to POSIX relative paths before adding to template maps          |

##### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: `trellis-meta` installs as `<platform-skill-root>/trellis-meta/SKILL.md` plus `references/**`, and `collectPlatformTemplates(platform)` returns the same files.
- Base: no bundled skills exist; existing `resolveSkills()` / `resolveAllAsSkills()` behavior remains unchanged.
- Bad: platform-specific configurators copy `trellis-meta` manually, creating a second installer that update hash tracking can miss.

##### 6. Tests Required

- Init integration test proving at least Claude and Codex write `trellis-meta/SKILL.md` plus one reference file.
- Configurator test proving configured files are byte-for-byte equal to `collectPlatformTemplates()` for every platform that writes skills.
- Regression test proving `.trellis/.template-hashes.json` includes bundled skill reference files after init.
- Release smoke test when a changelog or docs page claims the skill is
  bundled: build the CLI, verify the skill appears in `npm pack --dry-run
--json` under `dist/templates/common/bundled-skills/<skill>/`, then run the
  built binary in a fresh temp repository and confirm both generated skill
  files and `.trellis/.template-hashes.json` contain the skill paths.

##### 7. Wrong vs Correct

Wrong:

```typescript
files.set(".claude/skills/trellis-meta/SKILL.md", metaSkillContent);
```

Correct:

```typescript
for (const [filePath, content] of collectSkillTemplates(
  skillRoot,
  resolveSkills(ctx),
  resolveBundledSkills(ctx),
)) {
  files.set(filePath, content);
}
```

**Rule**: Do not add a parallel installer for built-in multi-file skills. Every bundled file reaches disk through the platform's one template map, so `.trellis/.template-hashes.json` tracks it automatically. The failure this rule still guards is the quiet one: forgetting the third argument, which ships zero bundled skills on that platform with no test failure. Cover it with one reference file by name (for example `trellis-meta/references/core/template-pipeline.md`) in `test/templates/<platform>.test.ts`.

**Release rule**: A bundled skill is not release-ready until it has passed the
source, dist, generated-files, and update-tracking chain:
`src/templates/common/bundled-skills/<skill>/` ->
`dist/templates/common/bundled-skills/<skill>/` -> platform skill roots after
built-binary `trellis init` -> `.trellis/.template-hashes.json` -> built-binary
`trellis update --dry-run` with no pending changes.

### Step 5: Template Extraction

| File                       | Change                                                                                                                                              |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/templates/extract.ts` | Only needed if platform has a physical template directory. Most new platforms generate from `common/` templates and don't need extraction functions |

> Note: Platforms using `createTemplateReader(import.meta.url)` in their `index.ts` handle their own template reading. The `extract.ts` functions (`getTrellisSourcePath()`, `readTrellisFile()`, `copyTrellisDir()`) are primarily for the `.trellis/` workflow files, not platform templates.

### Step 6: Python Scripts (independent runtime)

> **Warning**: `cli_adapter.py` uses if/elif/else chains with NO exhaustive check. New platforms silently fall through to the `else` branch (Claude defaults). You MUST add explicit branches for **every method** listed below.

| File                                                  | Change                                                                                                          |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/templates/trellis/scripts/common/cli_adapter.py` | Add to `Platform` literal type, `config_dir_name` property, `detect_platform()`, `get_cli_adapter()` validation |

### Active Task Resolution

Current-task state is session/window scoped. New hook, statusline, and
sub-agent consumers must call the shared resolver path:

| Runtime                         | Resolver surface                                                                           |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Python hooks/statusline/scripts | `.trellis/scripts/common/active_task.py`                                                   |
| Existing Python callers         | `common.paths.get_current_task()` / `get_current_task_abs()` / `get_current_task_source()` |

Do not add direct `.trellis/.current-task` reads in hooks, statusline scripts,
or sub-agent context injection. Direct reads reintroduce multi-window task
pollution.

Context-key precedence, as implemented in `active_task.py:resolve_context_key`:

1. `TRELLIS_CONTEXT_ID` environment override for subprocesses.
2. From the hook payload: `session_id`, `sessionId`, or `sessionID`.
3. From the hook payload: `conversation_id` / `conversationId` / `conversationID`.
4. From the hook payload: `transcript_path` / `transcriptPath` / `transcript`
   when non-empty.
5. A platform-native session environment variable — but only for the handful of
   names that have actually been verified to exist, and only for the platform
   the resolver detected (`_iter_env_keys` filters by platform name, so one
   platform's entry cannot fire in another's session).
6. A short-lived shell ticket, checked **last** and **not** gated on platform
   name — see "Shell-ticket bridge" below. Last on purpose: a platform that
   genuinely exports identity into the shell outranks a ticket written on its
   behalf.

The env table lives near the top of `active_task.py`. Do not add a name to it by
analogy with a neighbour: a 2026-08-05 audit found most pattern-guessed
`<PLATFORM>_SESSION_ID` names had never existed anywhere. The provenance
convention that came out of it is in `script-conventions.md` → "Session env var
names carry their provenance", and it is binding on this file too — no
platform's session env var may be named here without the same grade of evidence.
The two verified names are `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` (Claude Code) and
`CODEX_THREAD_ID` (Codex).

A host may send `transcript_path: null`; this must not prevent session scoping
when `session_id` or `conversation_id` is present.

`task.py start <task>` has no hook stdin when it is run as a normal shell
command. It can write session-local state only when a context key is available
through `TRELLIS_CONTEXT_ID` or a platform-native environment variable exposed
by the host. Hooks should pass `TRELLIS_CONTEXT_ID` to subprocesses they launch.
Claude Code is special: SessionStart provides `CLAUDE_ENV_FILE`, so the shared
hook must persist `export TRELLIS_CONTEXT_ID=<context-key>` there for later Bash
tool calls in the same conversation. **No researched platform has a reliable
command-env bridge**, so every hook-capable platform with a pre-shell event gets
the shell ticket instead (see below). Without one of these session signals,
`task.py start` must fail with a clear session identity hint and must not write
`.trellis/.current-task`.

#### Shell-ticket bridge (platform-neutral)

The premise: no researched platform exports a session id into its shell tool's
child process, but every hook-capable one puts that id on hook stdin. So a hook
registered on the host's pre-shell event writes a short-lived ticket, and
`task.py` reads it back.

No currently registered platform ships a ticket **writer**: Claude Code exports
`CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` (plus the `CLAUDE_ENV_FILE` bridge) and Codex exports
`CODEX_THREAD_ID`, so both resolve identity without one. `active_task.py` still
reads tickets from `.trellis/.runtime/shell-tickets/`, which is what a new
platform with a pre-shell hook event would write to.

The full contract — payload shape, the four acceptance conditions, and the
install-directory rule that decides the ticket's context key — is in
`script-conventions.md` → "Shell-ticket bridge". Read it before wiring the hook
into a new platform's config: getting the context key wrong makes `task.py
start` write a session file no hook ever reads, which half-works behind the
single-session fallback and breaks silently with two windows open.

Hook, statusline, or plugin output that mentions an active task should include
the source (`session` or `session:<key>`) so cross-window mistakes are visible
while debugging. Statuslines may shorten this to `[session]` to avoid noisy UI.

**Also update `task_store.py` when adding a sub-agent-capable platform**:

| File                                                 | Constant                        | When to update                                                                                                              |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/templates/trellis/scripts/common/task_store.py` | `_SUBAGENT_CONFIG_DIRS` (tuple) | Add `.{configDir}/` if the new platform can spawn sub-agents (Class-1 hook-inject, Class-2 pull-based, or extension-backed) |

This tuple is consulted by `cmd_create` to decide whether to seed `implement.jsonl` / `check.jsonl` for the new task. A platform that cannot spawn sub-agents MUST be excluded — it doesn't consume jsonl.

Python scripts run at user-project runtime and can't import from the TS `AI_TOOLS` registry, so they maintain their own parallel registry. When adding or removing sub-agent capability, update both in tandem.

> **Codex-specific CLIAdapter notes:**
>
> - `config_dir_name` returns `".codex"` (not `".agents"`)
> - `get_agent_path` returns `.toml` for codex (not `.md`)
> - `requires_agent_definition_file` is `False` — Codex auto-discovers agents from `.codex/agents/*.toml`, no `--agent` CLI flag
> - `detect_platform` checks `.codex/` existence (not `.agents/skills/`)

**Repo-global, not Codex-specific**: the shipped script tree
(`packages/cli/src/templates/trellis/scripts/`) and Trellis's own dogfood copy
(`.trellis/scripts/`) must stay byte-identical. This is now build-enforced —
see `script-conventions.md` → "Two script trees, one content".

### Scenario: Codex Native `SubagentStart` Context Delivery

#### 1. Scope / Trigger

Trigger: Codex has a native sub-agent start hook. Trellis must send only the
dispatched role's task context to a child without letting a stale environment
override the parent session or letting a missing parent borrow another window's
task.

#### 2. Signatures

```python
def resolve_active_task(
    repo_root: Path,
    platform_input: dict[str, Any] | None = None,
    platform: str | None = None,
    *,
    allow_single_session_fallback: bool = True,
    allow_environment_context: bool = True,
) -> ActiveTask: ...
```

The native hook path calls this resolver with `platform="codex"`,
`allow_single_session_fallback=False`, and
`allow_environment_context=False`. Other callers retain both defaults.

#### 3. Contracts

- Generated `.codex/hooks.json` keeps `UserPromptSubmit` and adds a
  `SubagentStart` matcher for exactly `trellis-implement`, `trellis-check`,
  and `trellis-research`.
- Codex hook input uses parent `session_id`, `agent_type`, and `cwd`. A valid
  result is JSON with
  `hookSpecificOutput.hookEventName="SubagentStart"` and
  `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` beginning with
  `<!-- trellis-hook-injected -->`.
- Implement/check context order is role JSONL, `prd.md`, optional `design.md`,
  then optional `implement.md`. Research receives the resolved `Active task:`
  path and research-only context; it must not read implement/check manifests.
- Codex may truncate model-visible `SubagentStart.additionalContext`, retain a
  head/tail preview, and add `Full hook output saved to: <path>`. Custom role
  profiles must treat this notice as stronger evidence than the marker: read
  the saved full output first, use the role-specific `Active task:` pull
  fallback if that read fails, and accept the marker as complete only when no
  saved-output notice is present. Marker absence without a saved-output notice
  also uses the pull fallback.
- Native dispatch (`codex.dispatch_mode: auto`) does not set a model on the
  spawned sub-agent by default — Codex's own precedence (spawn value ->
  `[agents]` default -> parent) means the child **inherits the main
  session's model** unless the generated `.codex/agents/trellis-*.toml`
  pins one. Users tune this by editing `model` / `model_reasoning_effort`
  directly on those three files (matches Codex's own docs); there is no
  `.trellis/config.yaml` indirection. `configureCodex()` and
  `collectTemplateFiles()` (via `preserveCodexAgentModelKeys()` in
  `configurators/codex.ts`) both extract any existing top-level `model` /
  `model_reasoning_effort` lines from the on-disk file and re-insert them
  after `sandbox_mode` in the freshly rendered template before writing or
  hashing, so `trellis init` / `trellis update` never clobber a user-pinned
  model and never flag the pinned lines as a modified-file conflict. Static
  templates ship these as commented hint lines only.

#### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition                                                    | Required result                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| recognised role + parent session maps to a live task         | emit role-specific `additionalContext`       |
| unknown/missing/malformed parent session                     | exit successfully with no output             |
| one unrelated runtime session exists                         | no output; never use sole-session fallback   |
| inherited `TRELLIS_CONTEXT_ID` conflicts with parent session | parent `session_id` wins on this native path |
| stale/missing task, malformed hook JSON, or unexpected error | fail open; Codex still starts the child      |
| non-Trellis `agent_type`                                     | no Trellis output                            |
| complete output contains marker and no saved-output notice   | child uses the injected role context directly |
| output contains `Full hook output saved to: <path>`          | child reads the referenced full output before role work |
| referenced full-output file cannot be read                   | child uses its role-specific `Active task:` pull fallback |
| no saved-output notice and marker is absent                  | child uses its role-specific `Active task:` pull fallback |

#### 5. Good / Base / Bad Cases

- Good: a parent session dispatches `trellis-implement`; the child receives
  its curated implementation context and does not dispatch another role.
- Good: Codex truncates a long payload but supplies a saved-output path; the
  child reads that file before using any marker retained in the head preview.
- Base: project Hook trust is pending; the child reads the dispatch prompt's
  `Active task:` value and follows the marker-absent pull protocol.
- Bad: a retained marker causes the child to ignore a saved-output notice, or
  research loads `implement.jsonl` / `check.jsonl`.

#### 6. Tests Required

- Parse generated Hook config and assert both event registrations plus the
  narrowed matcher.
- Black-box the shared hook for valid, unknown, malformed, concurrent, and
  non-Trellis subagents; assert the output envelope, marker, ordering, and
  environment-override isolation.
- Cover `auto` default, explicit `inline`, legacy `sub-agent`, and invalid
  configuration across JSONL seeding, effective workflow platform, and the
  Codex workflow-state banner.
- Assert `configureCodex()` and `collectPlatformTemplates("codex")` remain
  byte-equivalent and distribute the shared injector.
- Assert all three generated role profiles place the saved-output notice check
  before marker handling, fall back when the saved file is unreadable or the
  marker is absent, and preserve implement/check/research role boundaries.

#### 7. Wrong vs Correct

**Wrong:** call the ordinary resolver with defaults from `SubagentStart`; its
environment override and single-session compatibility fallback can select a
different parent task.

**Correct:** make the strict native call explicit while preserving the defaults
for legacy shell, hook, and pull-based consumers.

**Wrong:** treat `<!-- trellis-hook-injected -->` as proof that the entire
model-visible payload survived host truncation.

**Correct:** let `Full hook output saved to: <path>` take precedence, read that
file first, and use the role-specific pull fallback only when recovery fails.

### Step 7: Documentation

| File           | Change                                         |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `README.md`    | Add platform to supported tools list           |
| `README_CN.md` | Add platform to supported tools list (Chinese) |

### Step 8: Build Scripts

| File                        | Change                                                      |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `scripts/copy-templates.js` | No change needed (copies entire `src/templates/` directory) |

### Step 9: Project Config (Optional)

If Trellis project itself should support the new platform:

| Directory                       | Contents                       |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `.{platform}/`                  | Project's own config directory |
| `.{platform}/commands/trellis/` | Slash commands                 |
| `.{platform}/agents/`           | Agents                         |
| `.{platform}/hooks/`            | Hooks                          |
| `.{platform}/settings.json`     | Settings                       |

### Step 10: Gitignore

| File         | Change                                                    |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.gitignore` | Add local config patterns (e.g., `{platform}.local.json`) |

### Step 11: Tests (MANDATORY)

> **Warning**: Dynamic iteration tests (e.g., `PLATFORM_IDS.forEach`) only verify registry metadata. They do NOT cover platform-specific runtime behavior. You MUST add explicit tests.

| Test File                                | What to Add                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `test/templates/{platform}.test.ts`      | **NEW FILE**: Verify the platform's template-module readers (`getAllAgents()`, `getAllHooks()`, `getHooksConfig()`, `getSettings()` — whichever it exposes) return the expected set, content non-empty, format valid. Assert one bundled skill file by name if the platform ships them |
| `test/configurators/platforms.test.ts`   | Detection test: `getConfiguredPlatforms` recognizes tracked Trellis templates but ignores native platform directories. Content test: `configurePlatform` writes the expected paths, no compiled artifacts. **The `configure` ⟷ `collectTemplates` parity assertions are registry-wide and cover a new platform automatically — do not copy them per platform** |
| `test/commands/init.integration.test.ts` | Init test: `init({ {platform}: true })` creates correct directory. Negative assertions: add `.{configDir}` checks to existing platform tests                                                                            |
| `test/templates/extract.test.ts`         | `get{Platform}TemplatePath()` returns existing dir. `get{Platform}SourcePath()` deprecated alias equals template path                                                                                                   |
| `test/regression.test.ts`                | Platform registration: `AI_TOOLS.{platform}` exists with correct `configDir`. Update the `withTracking` list if `collectTemplates` is defined |

## Declaring a shared hook is half the wiring

### 1. Scope / Trigger

Infra wiring: a hook script only runs if two independent things agree — the
distribution table that puts the file on disk, and the platform's own hook
config that invokes it. Those cannot be derived from one another, because each
vendor defines its own config format. A script on disk that nothing invokes is
indistinguishable from success: the file is there, the test that checks the
file is there passes, and the feature does nothing.

### 2. Signatures

```typescript
// templates/shared-hooks/index.ts:95-149 — the distribution half
export const SHARED_HOOKS_BY_PLATFORM: Record<
  SharedHookPlatform,
  readonly SharedHookName[]
>;

// configurators/shared.ts:571 — reads that table into the platform's map
export function collectSharedHooks(
  hooksPath: string,
  platform: SharedHookPlatform,
): Map<string, string>;
```

The invocation half has no shared signature — it is a literal inside each
platform's own config template (`.claude/settings.json`, `.codex/hooks.json`, …).

### 3. Contracts

- `SharedHookPlatform` is a string-union type, so a platform not in the union
  cannot be passed to `collectSharedHooks` at all. That is the guard for
  extension-backed platforms.
- Declaring a hook for a platform obliges its config template to invoke
  `hooks/<hook-name>` on whichever event the host publishes for it.
- The reverse also binds: a config that invokes a shared hook the platform does
  not declare points at a path that will never exist on disk.
- The hooks path passed to `collectSharedHooks` must be the same directory the
  config template references. There is no cross-check on that string beyond the
  substring match below, so a typo in one of the two shows up as a build
  failure, not a runtime one.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

Both directions are asserted in `test/templates/shared-hooks.test.ts:97-155`.
"Registration" means a non-`.md` file in the platform's template map contains
the substring `hooks/<hook-name>` — markdown is excluded because reference
tables name the file without invoking it.

| Condition | Failure |
| --- | --- |
| Platform declares the hook, no config template invokes it | "`<platform>` declares … but no `<platform>` config template invokes it — the script would be installed and never run" |
| Config template invokes it, platform does not declare it | "`<platform>` invokes … but does not declare it — the config points at a script that is never installed" |
| The filter stops matching anything (renamed hook, changed path shape) | `expect(declaring.length).toBeGreaterThan(0)` fails first, so the suite cannot pass vacuously |
| Platform in `SHARED_HOOKS_BY_PLATFORM` matches no `AI_TOOLS` cliFlag | `registrationsOf` throws |
| Platform collects no templates | `registrationsOf` throws — its config cannot be checked |

### 5. Good / Base / Bad Cases

- **Good** — a platform gains a pre-shell event: add it to the table *and* add the invocation to its config template, in the same change. The test proves both halves landed.
- **Base** — a platform with no pre-shell trigger is deliberately **not** wired: it declares no shell-session hook, so nothing is installed for an event that would never fire.
- **Bad** — declaring the hook and "wiring it later". The file ships, `trellis update` starts managing it, users see it in their repo, and nothing calls it. This is precisely the state the test now makes unreachable.

### 6. Tests Required

- Both direction assertions above, derived from `SHARED_HOOKS_BY_PLATFORM` — never from a hard-coded platform list.
- A non-vacuity assertion on the filter itself. Without it, renaming the hook turns every other assertion into a no-op that still passes.
- Per-platform registration tests for the hooks whose config shape is unusual.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```typescript
// shared-hooks/index.ts
foo: ["session-start.py", "inject-shell-session-context.py"],
```

with `templates/foo/hooks.json` unchanged. `.foo/hooks/inject-shell-session-context.py` is written, hash-tracked, and never executed.

#### Correct

```typescript
// shared-hooks/index.ts
foo: ["session-start.py", "inject-shell-session-context.py"],
```

```jsonc
// templates/foo/hooks.json — the other half
{
  "beforeShellExecution": [
    { "command": "{{PYTHON_CMD}} .foo/hooks/inject-shell-session-context.py" }
  ]
}
```

## What You DON'T Need to Update

These are now **automatically derived** from the registry:

| Previously hardcoded                          | Now derived from                                                       |
| --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `BACKUP_DIRS` in update.ts                    | `ALL_MANAGED_DIRS` from `configurators/index.ts`                       |
| `TEMPLATE_DIRS` in template-hash.ts           | `ALL_MANAGED_DIRS` from `configurators/index.ts`                       |
| `getConfiguredPlatforms()` in update.ts       | `getConfiguredPlatforms()` from `configurators/index.ts`               |
| `cleanupEmptyDirs()` whitelist in update.ts   | `isManagedPath()` / `isManagedRootDir()` from `configurators/index.ts` |

| `TOOLS[]` in init.ts                          | `getInitToolChoices()` from `configurators/index.ts`                   |
| Configurator dispatch in init.ts              | `configurePlatform()` from `configurators/index.ts`                    |
| Windows Python detection in init.ts           | `getPlatformsWithPythonHooks()` from `configurators/index.ts`          |

## Command Format by Platform

| Platform    | Command Format                                                         | File Format                                                   | Example (finish-work)        |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Claude Code | `/trellis:xxx`               | Markdown (`.md`)      | `/trellis:finish-work` |
| Codex       | `$<skill-name>` / `/skills` | Markdown (`SKILL.md`) | `$finish-work`         |

When creating platform templates, ensure references match the platform's interaction format and file format. The authoritative prefix is `AI_TOOLS[id].templateContext.cmdRefPrefix` — this table restates it for orientation, so check the registry when they disagree.

## Command Set by Platform Capability

Commands emitted by `resolveCommands(ctx)` / `resolveAllAsSkills(ctx)` / `resolveAllAsSkillsNeutral(ctx)` in `src/configurators/shared.ts`:

| Command       | `agentCapable && hasHooks`                                                                                                        | `agentCapable && !hasHooks`                                                                           |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `start`       | ✔ filtered by the shared resolver — a SessionStart-style hook injects opening context, so a user-facing `/start` would be redundant | ✅ emitted (skill and/or slash command per platform) — no hook fires, users need an invocable `start` |
| `continue`    | ✅ emitted                                                                                                                        | ✅ emitted                                                                                            |
| `finish-work` | ✅ emitted                                                                                                                        | ✅ emitted                                                                                            |

**Rule**: filter is by `ctx.agentCapable && ctx.hasHooks` — **both flags required** (changed in 0.6.4; the prior single-flag rule silently dropped `start` from Codex). `agentCapable` alone is not a proxy for "has a session-start mechanism" because an agent-capable platform can ship without a SessionStart-equivalent hook and rely on a user-invocable `start` instead.

- `agentCapable && hasHooks`: `claude-code`
- `agentCapable && !hasHooks`: `codex` — it has SessionStart / UserPromptSubmit hook entries in `.codex/hooks.json`, but registry-`hasHooks` marks the SessionStart-style *context-injection protocol* Trellis can rely on without a user-level opt-in, and Codex hooks require `features.hooks = true` in `~/.codex/config.toml` first.

These three groups are computed from `AI_TOOLS[id].templateContext`; if you change a flag, recount rather than editing one line.

> **Gotcha**: do not treat `hasHooks=false` as "platform has no automation at all". For Codex it means "no SessionStart-style protocol Trellis can rely on without a user-level opt-in" — its own hook config still injects context once enabled. The flag is a hook-protocol marker, not a capability summary. When filtering by capability, query the actual capability you need, never assume a default pairing from one boolean.

## Subagent Context Injection: Hook-based vs Pull-based

Trellis sub-agents (implement / check / research) need task context (`prd.md` + spec files listed in `implement.jsonl` / `check.jsonl`) at startup. There are **two** delivery classes depending on the platform's hook capabilities. The class-1 / class-2 labels below are also used by the `[workflow-state:in_progress]` breadcrumb body — keep terminology stable across writers.

| Class                     | Mechanism                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Platforms                |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Class-1** — Hook-inject | Native hook fires at sub-agent start and injects context before the child runs, either by rewriting the spawn prompt or adding developer context                                                            | Claude Code, Codex       |
| **Class-2** — Pull-based  | Platform lacks a Trellis-supported native sub-agent context injection hook; Trellis injects a "Required: Load Trellis Context First" prelude into each definition so the sub-agent reads context at startup | none currently installed |

### Class-1 — Hook-inject

The platform's native sub-agent-start hook delivers context before the child runs. Claude Code rewrites the spawn prompt; Codex emits developer context through `SubagentStart`. Trellis's `inject-subagent-context.py` reads `prd.md` + the JSONL-referenced spec files for that delivery.

| Platform    | Hook event                                   | Mechanism                                                        |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Claude Code | `PreToolUse` + matcher `Task`/`Agent`        | `updatedInput.prompt`                                            |
| Codex       | `SubagentStart` + exact Trellis-role matcher | `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext`; child-side pull fallback |

### Class-2 — Pull-based

### Class-2 — Pull-based (7 platforms)

A platform whose hook either does not expose a sub-agent-start event or cannot inject Trellis context falls into this class: sub-agents must read context themselves at startup, so Trellis injects a "Required: Load Trellis Context First" prelude into each sub-agent definition file (`injectPullBasedPreludeMarkdown()` / `injectPullBasedPreludeToml()` in `src/configurators/shared.ts`). No currently registered platform needs it — Codex keeps the same prelude in its agent prompts purely as a fallback for the case where its hooks are not enabled at the user level.

#### Active task discovery on class-2 platforms (issue #225)

Sub-agents on class-2 platforms run as **separate sessions** with their own session ids, and no session identity reaches them: the parent's key is not exported into the child, and on most platforms no session env var exists to export in the first place (see `### Active Task Resolution`). So the session-scoped resolver returns `None` for the sub-agent's own session key. To bridge that gap the prelude (`buildPullBasedPrelude` in `src/configurators/shared.ts`) tells sub-agents to discover the active task in this order:

1. **`Active task: <path>` line in dispatch prompt** — primary path. The main agent is required by `workflow.md`'s `[workflow-state:in_progress]` breadcrumb to prefix every sub-agent dispatch (including `trellis-research`, since 0.5.8) with `Active task: <path from task.py current>`. The breadcrumb fires on every `UserPromptSubmit` while `task.json.status == in_progress`, so the rule is reinjected per turn.
2. **`task.py current --source`** — secondary. Resolves via the session-scoped runtime store. Returns `Source: session:<key>` on a precise match, or `Source: session-fallback:<key>` when the runtime contains exactly one session file (single-window inference; see `_resolve_single_session_fallback` in `active_task.py`). Returns nothing when ≥2 session files exist — refuses to guess across windows so 04-21's multi-session isolation contract holds.
3. **Ask the user** — terminal fallback when both above yield nothing.

When changing the prelude, the dispatch protocol, or the `session-fallback` semantics, all three layers must stay aligned. `regression.test.ts > [issue-225]` and `regression.test.ts > [session-fallback]` are the contract tests; `templates/trellis.test.ts > [issue-225]` asserts the workflow.md breadcrumb still carries the protocol. Manual e2e runbook lives in the historical task `.trellis/tasks/<archive>/05-04-fix-codex-subagent-missing-active-task/manual-verify.md`.

### Subagent dispatch protocol — single source of truth

The dispatch protocol text (the `Active task: <path>` first-line rule plus the class-1 / class-2 platform notes) lives in one writer:

| Writer              | Location                                                             | Consumed by                                                                                       |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Workflow breadcrumb | `templates/trellis/workflow.md` `[workflow-state:in_progress]` block | Python `inject-workflow-state.py` — surfaced per-turn while a task is in progress                 |

The breadcrumb is per-turn but only active when `task.json.status == in_progress`. Any second surface that restates the protocol (a tool description, an agent prelude) must be updated in the same commit, because a drift is silent: the model still sees *some* dispatch guidance, just inconsistent guidance, and the class-1 / class-2 fallback chain breaks in subtle ways.

#### Tests required

- Regression test asserting the `Active task:` rule appears in `templates/trellis/workflow.md` (`templates/trellis.test.ts > [issue-225]`).
- Regression test asserting `workflow.md` Phase 2.1 routes generated pull-based sub-agent definitions through the pull-based block, not the `The platform hook/plugin auto-handles` block. The test derives generated pull-based platforms from `collectPlatformTemplates()` by looking for `Required: Load Trellis Context First`; adding a new pull-based platform without adding its workflow marker mapping must fail.

### Implementation

Pull-based prelude is injected by `injectPullBasedPreludeMarkdown()` / `injectPullBasedPreludeToml()` in `src/configurators/shared.ts`. Each pull-based platform's configurator:

1. Calls `collectSharedHooks(dir, platform)` where `SHARED_HOOKS_BY_PLATFORM[platform]` excludes `inject-subagent-context.py` — no prompt-mutation hook installed
2. Calls `detectSubAgentType(name)` → `injectPullBasedPrelude*()` on every sub-agent definition before adding it to the map

Hook-inject platforms use the same `collectSharedHooks(dir, platform)` call with a capability-table entry that includes `inject-subagent-context.py`, and their hook-config template references that hook. Their generated agent definitions carry only the hook-failure fallback protocol, not the pull-based prelude.

### Recursion guard in implement/check agent definitions

Every generated `trellis-implement` and `trellis-check` agent definition must
carry an explicit recursion guard near the top of its instructions. The guard
must state that the reader is already the dispatched sub-agent, that any
SessionStart / workflow-state / workflow.md text saying to dispatch
`trellis-implement` or `trellis-check` applies only to the main session, and
that the agent must do its own work directly instead of spawning another
implement/check agent.

This rule applies to Markdown, TOML, JSON, and extension-backed agent
definitions. It is deliberately duplicated with the workflow-state breadcrumb:
some hosts can surface per-turn breadcrumbs inside sub-agent turns, while other
hosts rely only on the agent definition text. The two channels must both be
safe.


### Audit reference

Historical reliability audit (per-platform evidence, GitHub issues, Claude Code
canary test) lives in the archived task:

## Planning Artifact and JSONL Context Contract

### Scope / Trigger

Task planning is artifact-driven:

- `prd.md` is created by `task.py create` and stores requirements, constraints, and acceptance criteria.
- `design.md` is required for complex tasks and stores technical design, boundaries, data flow, contracts, and tradeoffs.
- `implement.md` is required for complex tasks and stores execution order, checklist, validation commands, and rollback points.
- `implement.jsonl` / `check.jsonl` are spec and research manifests for implement/check context. They do not replace `implement.md`.

Lightweight tasks may be PRD-only. Complex tasks must have `prd.md`, `design.md`, and `implement.md` before `task.py start` moves the task into implementation.

### Lifecycle

1. **Create** — `task.py create` writes `task.json` with `status = planning`, creates the default `prd.md`, and seeds `implement.jsonl` / `check.jsonl` when a sub-agent-capable platform is detected.
2. **Plan** — AI updates `prd.md`. If the task is complex, AI also writes `design.md` and `implement.md`; if sub-agent/spec context is needed, AI curates jsonl entries.
3. **Review / start** — the user reviews the planning artifacts. `task.py start` is valid when the task's artifact gate is satisfied.
4. **Consume** — hook and prelude read context in the same order: jsonl entries, `prd.md`, `design.md` if present, `implement.md` if present.

### Signatures

**Seed row schema** (one line, written by `_write_seed_jsonl` in `task_store.py`):

```json
{
  "_example": "Fill with {\"file\": \"<path>\", \"reason\": \"<why>\"}. Put spec/research files only — no code paths. Run `python3 .trellis/scripts/get_context.py --mode packages` to list available specs. Delete this line when done."
}
```

**Curated row schema** (written by AI):

```json
{ "file": "<repo-relative-path>", "reason": "<one-line rationale>" }
```

Optional `type: "directory"` is supported for directory entries. Consumers ignore any other fields.

### Contracts

| Contract                  | Enforcer                                        | Behavior                                                                           |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Task creation             | `task_store.py`                                 | Always creates default `prd.md`; never auto-creates `design.md` or `implement.md`. |
| Lightweight planning gate | workflow-state / SessionStart / continue        | PRD-only is valid when the task is clearly small.                                  |
| Complex planning gate     | workflow-state / SessionStart / continue        | Requires `prd.md`, `design.md`, and `implement.md` before `task.py start`.         |
| Seed detection            | Every jsonl consumer                            | Row without a `file` key is treated as non-entry and skipped.                      |
| Empty-file tolerance      | hook / prelude / plugin readers                 | Missing or seed-only jsonl is tolerated; task artifacts still load.                |
| Context order             | hook / prelude                                  | jsonl entries → `prd.md` → `design.md` if present → `implement.md` if present.     |
| Archived self-references  | `task_context.py` validation                    | Preserve JSONL bytes. For an archived task, remap only exact `.trellis/tasks/<same-task-name>/...` references into that archive copy. Other paths retain repo-root resolution. |

### Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition                                              | Behavior                                                                                              | Exit / Surface          |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `implement.jsonl` has only seed row                    | `cmd_validate` reports 0 errors; `cmd_list_context` prints "(no curated entries yet — only seed row)" | Exit 0                  |
| `implement.jsonl` entry points at non-existent file    | `cmd_validate` prints "File not found: …" per row                                                     | Exit 1                  |
| Archived self-reference exists in the archive copy     | Resolve inside `.trellis/tasks/archive/<year-month>/<same-task-name>/`; do not rewrite the manifest        | Exit 0                  |
| Archived self-reference is absent from the archive copy | Report it missing even if an active task with the same name has recreated the path                         | Exit 1                  |
| Archived self-reference traverses or follows a symlink outside the archive | Reject it as missing; never fall back to the historical active-task path                    | Exit 1                  |
| Lightweight task has only `prd.md`                     | Valid planning state; SessionStart / continue can ask for start review                                | No error                |
| Complex task is missing `design.md` or `implement.md`  | Stay in planning; ask user to complete missing planning artifacts                                     | Hook / command guidance |
| Sub-agent platform detected, but jsonl seed is missing | Context readers fall back to task artifacts and warn where applicable                                 | No create failure       |

### Good / Base / Bad Cases

- **Good**: complex task has `prd.md`, `design.md`, `implement.md`, and curated jsonl manifests. Context consumers load jsonl entries first, then all three artifacts.
- **Good (archived)**: a moved task keeps its JSONL byte-for-byte; validation binds exact historical self-references to files or directories inside its archive copy while unrelated repository paths still resolve from the repository root.
- **Base**: lightweight task has only `prd.md`. SessionStart / continue treats this as a valid planning state and may ask for start review.
- **Bad**: complex task has only `prd.md` plus seed-only jsonl. SessionStart / continue must keep the task in planning; it must not treat jsonl file existence as implementation readiness.
- **Bad (archived)**: validation resolves a historical self-reference through a recreated active task, or accepts `..` / a symlink that escapes the archived task directory.

### Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```python
def is_ready(task_dir: Path) -> bool:
    return (task_dir / "prd.md").is_file() and (task_dir / "implement.jsonl").is_file()
```

File existence alone cannot distinguish a lightweight PRD-only task from an incomplete complex task, and a seed-only jsonl manifest is not curated context.

#### Correct

```python
def planning_next_action(task_dir: Path, is_complex: bool, inline_mode: bool) -> str:
    if not (task_dir / "prd.md").is_file():
        return "write-prd"
    if is_complex and (
        not (task_dir / "design.md").is_file()
        or not (task_dir / "implement.md").is_file()
    ):
        return "complete-complex-artifacts"
    if not inline_mode and not has_curated_jsonl(task_dir):
        return "curate-jsonl"
    return "review-before-start"
```

The route depends on task intent, artifact presence, and execution mode. Missing optional artifacts are skipped for lightweight tasks, but complex tasks cannot enter implementation until their planning artifacts are complete.

For archived validation, resolving every JSONL path as `repo_root / file_path`
is wrong because a preserved self-reference points at the task's former active
location. Resolve only the exact same-task prefix against the archived task
directory, require its canonical target to stay within that directory, and
leave every unrelated path on normal repository-root resolution.

### Tests Required

- **Create behavior**: `task.py create` creates default `prd.md` and seeds jsonl only on sub-agent-capable platforms.
- **Consumer tolerance**: `inject-subagent-context.py` skips seed rows and still injects task artifacts.
- **Validate seed**: `task.py validate` treats seed-only jsonl as 0 errors.
- **Validate archive binding**: cover archived self files and directories, unrelated paths, a missing archive copy with a recreated active task, traversal, symlink escape, and unchanged active-task behavior.
- **List-context seed**: `task.py list-context` prints "no curated entries yet" for seed-only jsonl.
- **Artifact gates**: workflow-state, SessionStart, and continue distinguish PRD-only lightweight tasks from complex tasks that still need `design.md` / `implement.md`.

## Context Injection Limits Contract (`context_injection`)

### 1. Scope / Trigger

Sub-agent context injection caps how much task context is inlined into a
sub-agent's first prompt. Added for #441 (task
`07-22-subagent-context-limits`). The single implementation is
`packages/cli/src/templates/shared-hooks/inject-subagent-context.py`; if a
second one is ever added (a plugin or extension port), injection formatting,
caps, binary detection, and config keys must change in both in the same commit.

### 2. Signatures

- Python: `common.config.get_context_injection_limits() -> dict[str, int]`,
  `truncate_utf8(data: bytes, cap: int) -> bytes`,
  `_is_binary_content(data: bytes) -> bool`

### 3. Contracts

`.trellis/config.yaml` section (ships commented in the template; defaults live in code):

```yaml
context_injection:
  max_file_bytes: 32768 # per implement.jsonl / check.jsonl referenced file
  max_artifact_bytes: 65536 # per task artifact (prd.md / design.md / implement.md)
  max_total_bytes: 131072 # whole payload; overflow degrades to index lines
```

- `0` disables that limit; negative / non-int → default + stderr warning.
- Notice strings (byte-frozen, identical in all three implementations):
  - truncation: `\n[Trellis: truncated at {cap} bytes — read {path} for the full content]`
  - degradation: `[Trellis: not inlined (total context limit reached) — {path} ({size} bytes): {reason}]`
  - binary reference: `[Trellis: not inlined (binary file) — {path} ({size} bytes): {reason}]`
- Artifact reasons: `Requirements document` / `Technical design document` / `Execution plan document`.
- Accounting: `=== path ===` headers and notices count toward `max_total_bytes`.
  Processing order unchanged: jsonl entries first, then prd → design → implement.md.
- Truncation is UTF-8-safe: back off over continuation bytes; drop an incomplete lead byte.
- JSONL-referenced files are classified from bytes, not extensions. A NUL byte
  or invalid UTF-8 marks the file as binary. Binary bytes are never decoded or
  inlined, including when `max_file_bytes` and `max_total_bytes` are `0`; only
  the binary-reference notice counts toward the total budget.
- `task.py validate` emits non-blocking hygiene warnings (yellow, exit code unchanged):
  code-file extension outside `.trellis/spec/`, `docs/`, `docs-site/`, or the task's
  own dir; and entries larger than `max_file_bytes`.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

- unreadable referenced file → skipped (pre-existing behavior, unchanged)
- file > `max_file_bytes` → truncated + truncation notice
- artifact > `max_artifact_bytes` → truncated + truncation notice
- next block would exceed `max_total_bytes` → index line instead of content
- referenced file contains NUL or invalid UTF-8 → binary-reference notice only
- invalid config value → default for that key + stderr warning, never a crash

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: curated spec files of a few KB — output byte-identical to pre-cap behavior.
- Base: one 2 MiB file → ≤32 KiB inlined + notice; total payload ≤128 KiB.
- Binary: PNG or invalid UTF-8 with unlimited caps → path/size/reason notice,
  with no `=== path ===` block and no decoded bytes.
- Bad (guarded): setting values via env vars or CLI flags — not supported; config.yaml only.

### 6. Tests Required

- Python: `packages/cli/test/scripts/context-injection-limits.integration.test.ts`
  (probe-spawned; fixture matrix: at-cap / 1-over / UTF-8 straddle 2-byte & 3-byte /
  3-file total overflow / `0` disable / config override / golden under-cap / validate warnings).
- Template: `trellis.test.ts` asserts config.yaml's `context_injection` section exists and is fully commented.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

Change a notice string, binary predicate, or cap semantics in one implementation
only; infer binary content from the extension; or account only file bodies (not
headers/notices) toward the total budget.

#### Correct

Treat the notice strings, byte-based binary predicate, key names, ordering, and
accounting rules above as a frozen contract; change the loader and its
regression suite in the same commit.

## Parent / Child Task Tree Contract

### Scope / Trigger

Use parent/child task trees when a request contains multiple deliverables that can be planned, implemented, checked, and archived independently. The hierarchy is for work structure and review scope, not for dependency scheduling.

### Signatures

```bash
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py create "<title>" --slug <name> --parent <parent-dir>
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py add-subtask <parent-dir> <child-dir>
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py remove-subtask <parent-dir> <child-dir>
```

### Contracts

| Contract              | Enforcer                                      | Behavior                                                                                                                          |

| New child creation    | `task_store.py`                               | `create --parent` writes the child's `parent` field and appends the child directory name to the parent's `children` list.         |
| Existing task link    | `task_store.py`                               | `add-subtask` links two existing active tasks; the child must not already have a different parent.                                |
| Unlink                | `task_store.py`                               | `remove-subtask` removes the child from the parent's `children` and clears the child's `parent`.                                  |
| Parent responsibility | workflow / skills                             | Parent task owns source requirements, task map, cross-child acceptance, and final integration review.                             |
| Child responsibility  | workflow / skills                             | Child task owns one independently verifiable deliverable, including its own dependencies and acceptance criteria.                 |
| Archive progress      | `script-conventions.md` / `children_progress` | Parent `children` is historical. Archiving a child does not prune it from the parent; missing active children count as completed. |

### Good / Base / Bad Cases

- **Good**: parent task records the overall requirement set and lists child deliverables; each child has its own PRD and any ordering dependency is written in that child's planning artifacts.
- **Base**: a single lightweight task uses no parent/child structure.
- **Bad**: parent task is started as a generic "manager" implementation task while child tasks are the only real deliverables.
- **Bad**: one child depends on another but the dependency is only implied by the parent/child tree. The child artifact must state the dependency explicitly.

### Tests Required

- Workflow template guidance must mention when to use parent/child task trees and where dependency ordering belongs.
- Task system references must match the archive invariant in `script-conventions.md`.

## Workflow Step Detail Loading

`.trellis/workflow.md` contains per-phase step detail under `#### X.X` headings, with per-platform variants demarcated by `[Platform Name, ...]` … `[/Platform Name, ...]` blocks.

Load step detail on demand (both commands and hooks use this):

```bash
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/get_context.py --mode phase                                   # Phase Index (no --step)
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/get_context.py --mode phase --step 1.1                        # Step 1.1 (all platforms)
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/get_context.py --mode phase --step 1.2 --platform codex       # Step 1.2, codex-filtered
```

Platform markers are filtered by matching `[...]` block membership against the given platform name (case-insensitive; accepts `claude-code` and `Claude Code`). Lines outside any marker block are always kept.

---

## Windows Encoding Fix

All hook scripts that output to stdout must include the Windows encoding fix.
This includes the platform-specific `session-start.py` copy that opts out of
`shared-hooks/session-start.py` (`codex/hooks/session-start.py`), because it
still prints a JSON payload with `ensure_ascii=False`.

When a hook can resolve the Trellis project directory before printing, prefer
the shared helper from `.trellis/scripts/common/__init__.py`:

```python
def configure_project_encoding(project_dir: Path) -> None:
    scripts_dir = project_dir / ".trellis" / "scripts"
    if str(scripts_dir) not in sys.path:
        sys.path.insert(0, str(scripts_dir))

    try:
        from common import configure_encoding  # type: ignore[import-not-found]

        configure_encoding()
    except Exception:
        pass
```

Call it after resolving `project_dir` and before `json.dumps(...,
ensure_ascii=False)` is printed.

For standalone hooks that cannot safely import `.trellis/scripts/common`, use
the local fallback pattern:

```python
# IMPORTANT: Force stdout to use UTF-8 on Windows
# This fixes UnicodeEncodeError when outputting non-ASCII characters
if sys.platform == "win32":
    import io as _io
    if hasattr(sys.stdout, "reconfigure"):
        sys.stdout.reconfigure(encoding="utf-8", errors="replace")  # type: ignore[union-attr]
    elif hasattr(sys.stdout, "detach"):
        sys.stdout = _io.TextIOWrapper(sys.stdout.detach(), encoding="utf-8", errors="replace")  # type: ignore[union-attr]
```

### Tests Required

- Regression coverage must assert every platform-specific Python
  `session-start.py` template contains:
  - `from common import configure_encoding`
  - `configure_encoding()` before printing JSON
  - `ensure_ascii=False` at the JSON output boundary
- When a platform copies rather than consumes `shared-hooks/session-start.py`,
  treat Windows stdout encoding as part of the copied contract, not as an
  optional implementation detail.

## SessionStart Hook: additionalContext Size Constraint

### Adaptive First-Reply Notice

#### 1. Scope / Trigger

Trellis uses a one-shot visible acknowledgment as proof that otherwise-hidden
SessionStart context loaded. This contract applies to every live implementation
that already provides that proof: the shared Python hook used by Claude Code,
and Codex's own SessionStart hook.

The acknowledgment is an instruction inside the existing context string, not a
new payload field or host UI feature.

#### 2. Signatures

| Implementation                  | Injection signature                                                                                | Adaptive notice? |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------: |
| `shared-hooks/session-start.py` | Existing shared hook output (`hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` plus the snake_case alias)      |              Yes |
| `codex/hooks/session-start.py`  | Existing Codex SessionStart payload when hooks are enabled and approved                            |              Yes |

The **update-hint rider** (see below) is narrower still — it exists only in
`shared-hooks/session-start.py`. Codex's own `session-start.py` builds its own
payload and does not carry it.

#### 3. Contracts

- Put `<first-reply-notice>` near the top of model-visible startup context,
  before current-state or other orientation blocks.
- On the first visible assistant reply, briefly acknowledge that Trellis
  SessionStart context loaded, then continue directly with the user's request.
- Choose the acknowledgment language in this exact order:
  1. the language of the user's current request, meaning the user message that
     triggered the first visible reply;
  2. if that request has no clear natural language, an explicitly established
     project communication language;
  3. if neither provides a language, the language-neutral fallback exactly
     `Trellis SessionStart ✓`.
- The acknowledgment must not alter the language used for the remainder of the
  response.
- Emit the acknowledgment only once per session. Do not repeat it on later
  assistant replies.
- Do not infer a fallback language from operating-system locale, source files,
  README frequency, commit history, or other repository content.
- Keep hook payload keys, compact context content, event timing, and
  per-session deduplication unchanged.
- **The Trellis update reminder rides this block, and only this block.** When
  `get_update_hint()` returns a hint, exactly one line is inserted between the
  notice head and tail: `Also relay this Trellis maintenance notice on its own
  line in that same reply: {update_hint}`. When it returns `None` the notice is
  **byte-identical** to the plain `FIRST_REPLY_NOTICE` constant — no empty
  block, no placeholder line, nothing to diff. See "SessionStart update
  reminder" below.

#### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition                                                                                                    | Required behavior                                                                               |

| First request has a clear natural language                                                                   | Acknowledgment uses that request language; the rest of the response keeps its intended language |
| Request has no clear natural language and project instructions explicitly establish a communication language | Acknowledgment uses the explicit project language                                               |
| Neither request nor project instructions provide a language                                                  | Acknowledgment is exactly `Trellis SessionStart ✓`                                              |
| Later assistant reply in the same session                                                                    | No repeated acknowledgment                                                                      |
| Shared or Codex hook output                                                                                  | Existing payload keys and `SessionStart` event name remain unchanged                            |

#### 5. Good / Base / Bad Cases

- **Good:** an English request receives a brief English proof-of-load sentence,
  then the requested work continues in English.
- **Base:** a code-only request in a project that explicitly establishes Japanese
  as its communication language receives a brief Japanese acknowledgment.
- **Fallback:** a request and project with no language signal receive
  `Trellis SessionStart ✓`, then processing continues directly.
- **Bad:** the notice says `say once in Chinese`, requires `exactly one short
Chinese sentence`, includes a fixed Chinese acknowledgment, or causes the
  remainder of an otherwise non-Chinese response to switch languages.

#### 6. Tests Required

- Execute shared and Codex hook templates; assert exact payload shape, normal
  compact context blocks, the adaptive priority, neutral fallback, one-shot
  rule, and absence of fixed Chinese wording.
- Validate the injected instruction contract deterministically. Do not attempt
  to test an LLM's actual language classification in template tests.

#### 7. Wrong vs Correct

```text
# Wrong: fixed language steers the conversation
<first-reply-notice>Say once in Chinese that Trellis loaded.</first-reply-notice>

# Correct: request language -> explicit project language -> neutral fallback
<first-reply-notice>
Use the language of the user message that triggered this reply. If it has no
clear natural language, use an explicitly established project communication
language. Otherwise output exactly `Trellis SessionStart ✓`. Continue directly
without altering the language of the remainder of the response. Emit once.
</first-reply-notice>
```

### SessionStart update reminder

#### 1. Scope / Trigger

Cross-layer contract change: a Python module's private helper became public and
gained a second caller in a different layer (the shared hook), and that caller
changes user-visible output. The reminder previously existed only on the
`get_context.py` text-mode path, so hook-driven platforms — Claude Code
included — never saw it. This repo ran ten versions behind before anyone
noticed.

#### 2. Signatures

```python
# .trellis/scripts/common/session_context.py:460
def get_update_hint(repo_root: Path, context_key: str | None = None) -> str | None

# .trellis/scripts/common/session_context.py:421 (private)
def _update_marker_path(repo_root: Path, context_key: str | None = None) -> Path

# shared-hooks/session-start.py:322 (private)
def _resolve_update_hint(trellis_dir: Path, context_key: str | None) -> str | None

# shared-hooks/session-start.py:85 (private)
def _build_first_reply_notice(update_hint: str | None) -> str
```

#### 3. Contracts

- `get_update_hint` returns `"Trellis update available: {current} -> {latest}, run trellis update"` or `None`. It is public because two layers call it; do not re-privatize.
- `context_key` is **passed in, not re-resolved**. The hook already read the session id from hook stdin; that is more reliable than `session_context`'s environment-only fallback chain. Shell entry points pass nothing and keep the old behavior.
- The once-per-session marker is `.trellis/.runtime/update-check-{safe_key}.marker`, where `safe_key` is the sanitized context key truncated to 160 chars. With no context key it falls back to `TERM_SESSION_ID`, then `ppid-{n}`. **That fallback is why the key must be threaded through**: `TERM_SESSION_ID` identifies a terminal *window*, so the marker would mute the reminder for every later session opened in the same window.
- The marker is written before the version comparison, not after, so a probe that finds no update still costs one `trellis --version` per session rather than one per turn.
- The whole path is best-effort. A missing scripts dir, an import error, or any exception while probing versions leaves the payload untouched (`session-start.py:341` catches bare `Exception` on purpose).
- Scope is the shared hook only. Codex's own `session-start.py` builds its own payload and does not carry the rider.

#### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Marker already exists for this context key | `None` — no version probe at all |
| No project version readable | `None` |
| Version probe fails, hangs, or the CLI is absent | `None`, marker **not** written, so the next session retries |
| Current version ≥ latest | Marker written, `None` returned |
| Current version < latest | Marker written, hint returned |
| Hint is `None` | Notice is byte-identical to `FIRST_REPLY_NOTICE` |
| Scripts dir missing / import fails | `None`; SessionStart context still emitted normally |

#### 5. Good / Base / Bad Cases

- **Good:** a session on an outdated install gets one extra line inside `<first-reply-notice>`, the model relays it on its own line in the first reply, and no later turn repeats it.
- **Base:** an up-to-date install produces the unchanged notice, byte for byte. This is the property to assert — it is what proves the feature is invisible when it has nothing to say.
- **Bad:** the reminder is added as a separate context block. It then lives where `<first-reply-notice>` does not — model context nobody reads — which is the exact failure this change fixed.

#### 6. Tests Required

- `regression.test.ts` `[session-update-hint]`: assert the hint line appears between head and tail when a newer version is available. Assertion point is the rendered payload string, not `get_update_hint`'s return value.
- Assert byte-identity of the notice against `FIRST_REPLY_NOTICE` when no hint exists.
- Assert a failing or hanging `trellis` CLI leaves the payload untouched **and** leaves the check for the next session (covered by "[session-update-hint] a failing or hanging trellis CLI stays silent and leaves the check for the next session").
- Assert the marker filename derives from the passed context key, not from `TERM_SESSION_ID`, when both are present.

#### 7. Wrong vs Correct

##### Wrong

```python
# A second, always-present block
blocks.append(f"<trellis-update>{get_update_hint(repo_root)}</trellis-update>")
```

Two problems: it emits an empty block when there is no hint (so every payload differs from the previous release's bytes), and it lands in a channel the model reads but never speaks.

##### Correct

```python
notice = _build_first_reply_notice(_resolve_update_hint(trellis_dir, context_key))
```

One line inside the block that is already contracted to become spoken output; identical bytes to the plain constant when there is nothing to say.

### Per-Platform Output Schema

`shared-hooks/session-start.py` emits both the nested camelCase shape and the
top-level snake_case alias, because hosts differ in which one they read:

```python
{
    # Nested camelCase — Claude Code
    "hookSpecificOutput": {
        "hookEventName": "SessionStart",
        "additionalContext": context_text,
    },
    # Top-level snake_case alias for hosts that read this instead
    "additional_context": context_text,
}
```

Each host ignores keys it does not recognize, so dual emission is safe. Keep both
keys unless a host is verified to reject the alias — `inject-subagent-context.py`
is the counter-example: it emits the single nested `hookSpecificOutput.updatedInput`
shape, because that is the one Claude Code's PreToolUse contract defines.

### Constraint

Claude Code truncates `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` at **~20 KB**. When exceeded, only a ~2 KB preview is shown and the full payload is written to a fallback file (`tool-results/hook-*-additionalContext.txt`). AI agents do **not** proactively read the fallback file, so any content past the preview is effectively invisible.

Codex has even tighter limits — users report 40-80 KB payloads consuming most of the context window on large projects.

### Size Budget (measured on Trellis dev repo)

| Block                |       Size | Notes                                                                                                                                 |

| `<ready>`            |     0.1 KB | Fixed                                                                                                                                 |

Historical note: pre-workflow-rewrite (v0.4.0-beta.10) the payload included a 16 KB `<instructions>` block (start.md content). Later iterations injected a large `<workflow>` block. Current SessionStart uses `<trellis-workflow>` with a compact Phase Index and leaves detailed steps to `/trellis:continue` / phase-context loading.

### Guidelines: Paths-only

Before: every `.trellis/spec/*/index.md` was inlined in `<guidelines>` (10 KB+
on this repo). Main agents rarely need every index at SessionStart, and
sub-agents receive their specific spec / research context through
`implement.jsonl` / `check.jsonl` or pull-based prelude loading.

Now: `<guidelines>` contains only the artifact read order and available spec
index paths, including `.trellis/spec/guides/index.md`. Agents read the relevant
index on demand after the task and phase are known.

### Task Status Guidance

`SessionStart` reports task status and artifact presence, but it does not
approve implementation. Planning tasks stay behind the review gate: lightweight
tasks may be PRD-only, while complex tasks need `prd.md`, `design.md`, and
`implement.md` before `task.py start`.

For `in_progress` tasks, `SessionStart` points the AI to the per-turn
`<workflow-state>` block and restates the implementation/check context order.
Dispatch-vs-inline behavior belongs to workflow-state, skills, and agent
definitions, not to a large SessionStart instruction block.

### Design Decision: Inject Orientation, Not References

**Context**: earlier SessionStart payloads injected full `workflow.md`, full
`get_context.py` output, and sometimes command-sized instruction blocks. Large
repositories crossed host truncation thresholds, leaving the AI with a preview
instead of the actual workflow guidance.

**Decision**: SessionStart now injects only compact orientation:

1. compact current state (developer, git summary, active task, journal, spec
   index count)
2. compact `<trellis-workflow>` Phase Index
3. artifact read order and spec index paths
4. current `<task-status>`

Detailed workflow steps, task artifacts, and spec content are loaded on demand
through `/trellis:continue`, `get_context.py --mode phase --step <X.Y>`, skills,
sub-agent context injection, or pull-based preludes.

**Rule**: When adding content to SessionStart, prefer paths and one-action
orientation over inline reference text. Keep the measured total comfortably
below host truncation limits.

## Workflow State Injection: Per-Turn Breadcrumb

### Problem

`SessionStart` only fires once per session. In long conversations, Claude's context compression can push the SessionStart message out of recent context, and the AI forgets the active Trellis task — resulting in workflow drift (skips `check`, forgets to `update-spec`, doesn't return to `finish` after user interruptions).

### Solution: `UserPromptSubmit` hook injecting per-turn breadcrumb

A lightweight hook (`shared-hooks/inject-workflow-state.py`) fires on **every user prompt**, emitting a short `<workflow-state>` block reminding the AI of the active task + expected flow. Keep the payload compact and directive; it is injected every turn.

### Skip keyword (`prompt_injection.skip_keyword`, #427)

A user prompt containing the skip keyword (default `no-trellis`) mutes the per-turn
breadcrumb for that turn only — the hook exits 0 with empty stdout before any task
resolution or file reads. Contract:

- Match rule (frozen):
  case-insensitive `(?<![\w-])<keyword>(?![\w-])` — `no-trellisfoo`/`foo-no-trellis`
  do not match; `path/no-trellis.md` does (accepted false-positive).
- Config: `.trellis/config.yaml` → `prompt_injection.skip_keyword`
  (ships commented; default in code via `common.config.get_prompt_injection_config()`;
  quoted `""` explicitly disables the hatch).
- Scope: per-turn breadcrumb ONLY. `session-start.py` and
  `inject-subagent-context.py` must never gain keyword handling.
- Dogfood copies to keep patched region-identically: `.claude/hooks/` and
  `.codex/hooks/` `inject-workflow-state.py`.

### Single Source of Truth: `workflow.md` Tag Blocks

Breadcrumb text lives in `workflow.md` as `[workflow-state:STATUS]...[/workflow-state:STATUS]` blocks (same tag style as existing `[Platform, ...]` blocks). Users who fork the Trellis workflow edit **only the markdown**; the hook script stays untouched.

```markdown
[workflow-state:in_progress]
Flow: trellis-implement → trellis-check → trellis-update-spec → finish
Next required action: inspect conversation history + git status, then execute the next uncompleted step in that sequence.
For agent-capable platforms, do NOT edit code in the main session; dispatch `trellis-implement` for implementation and dispatch `trellis-check` before reporting completion.
[/workflow-state:in_progress]
```

STATUS matches `task.json.status`. Built-in: `planning` / `in_progress` / `completed`. Custom statuses (including hyphenated like `in-review`) are recognized — STATUS regex is `[A-Za-z0-9_-]+`.

### Fallback Strategy (hook never crashes)

1. `workflow.md` missing → hardcoded defaults for 3 built-in statuses
2. Tag block missing for a status → same hardcoded default
3. Status unknown (no tag, no default) → generic `"Refer to workflow.md for current step."`
4. No session active task → emit `no_task` pseudo-status breadcrumb instead of silent-exit. Header is `Status: no_task`; body nudges AI to load `trellis-brainstorm` + `task.py create` for multi-step work (or answer directly for trivial asks).

### Design Principle: Per-Turn Hooks Must Not Silent-Exit on "Nothing to Say"

A hook whose job is to **re-ground the AI every turn** should always emit _something_. Silent-exit looks cheaper but defeats the whole purpose — the turn where there's "nothing" is often the most important one (e.g. user switches topics, hops into a fresh subject without an active task).

**Wrong** — hook exits silently when no session active task exists:

```python
task = get_active_task(root)
if task is None:
    return 0  # nothing to inject; goodbye
```

Net effect on a "no task" session: AI sees the Next-Action only at SessionStart; after 20 turns of context compression, the guidance is gone and AI forgets to use `trellis-brainstorm` for new multi-step requests.

**Correct** — treat "no task" as its own pseudo-status with a dedicated breadcrumb template:

```python
task = get_active_task(root)
if task is None:
    breadcrumb = build_breadcrumb(task_id=None, status="no_task", templates=...)
else:
    breadcrumb = build_breadcrumb(*task, templates=...)
```

The same rule applies to every other hook that's positioned as "repeated reminder": if the hook isn't emitting, the reminder loop is broken. The only legitimate silent-exit case is when **the hook doesn't own this codebase at all** (e.g. `.trellis/` not found → definitely not a Trellis project → OK to no-op).

### Platform Support Matrix

| Platform    | Event              | Config File             | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ----------- | ------------------ | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Claude Code | `UserPromptSubmit` | `.claude/settings.json` | Shared `inject-workflow-state.py`, distributed via `SHARED_HOOKS_BY_PLATFORM.claude`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Codex       | `UserPromptSubmit` | `.codex/hooks.json`     | **Requires `features.hooks = true` in the user's `~/.codex/config.toml` (Codex 0.129+; legacy: `codex_hooks = true`).** Codex 0.129+ also requires running `/hooks` once to approve the installed hook before it activates — until approved, hooks never fire, and the trellis-bootstrap fallback in the hook covers the gap. |

### CWD Robustness

The hook uses `find_trellis_root()` to walk up from CWD until it finds `.trellis/`, so it works when the terminal is in a subdirectory (monorepo package, etc.) or when sub-agent spawn inherits a drifted CWD.

A host that may launch from a nested directory needs the script path itself to be
CWD-robust: prefer the host's project-root placeholder in the hook command over a
cwd-relative path. The Python hook's `find_trellis_root()` only runs after Python
opens the script, so a cwd-relative command can fail before the hook starts.

### Why No State Machine / No Extra `task.json` Fields

After first-principles analysis (historical task:
`.trellis/tasks/archive/2026-04/04-17-workflow-enforcement-v2/prd.md`), we
dropped the original design's `current_phase` string / `phase_history` /
`checkpoints` / 7 new `task.py` commands / skill tail blocks. The core insight:
**workflow.md Phase 1.0/1.1/... is documentation layering, not runtime state**.
The existing `task.json.status` (`planning` / `in_progress` / `completed`) is
sufficient to express task lifecycle; sub-phase position is inferred by the AI
from conversation history + git state.

This keeps state minimal, avoids the "task.json drifts from filesystem reality" class of bugs, and is trivially customizable — users modify one markdown file, not Python/TypeScript.

## Bootstrap & Joiner Task Auto-Generation

`trellis init` generates a first-session task based on checkout state. Three branches dispatch off two filesystem flags:

| `.trellis/` exists? | `.trellis/.developer` exists? | Meaning                                                           | Task generated                           |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| no                  | n/a                           | First-time `init` on this project                                 | `00-bootstrap-guidelines` (creator flow) |
| yes                 | no                            | Fresh clone / per-checkout first-init (new machine, new teammate) | `00-join-<slug>` (joiner flow)           |
| yes                 | yes                           | Same dev re-running init                                          | none (no-op)                             |

### Design Decision: `.developer` File Is the Per-Checkout Signal

**Context**: we need a signal for "this checkout has never been init'd by this developer before" to trigger joiner onboarding.

**Options Considered**:

1. `.trellis/workspace/<name>/` directory existence — ❌ this dir is committed to git, so a fresh clone already has it
2. A registry file listing onboarded developers — ❌ needs migration + bookkeeping, over-engineered for single-user checkouts
3. `.trellis/.developer` file existence — ✅ **chosen**

**Decision**: Use `.trellis/.developer` (gitignored) as the per-checkout onboarding signal.

**Why**: `.trellis/.developer` is declared in `.trellis/.gitignore` (template `gitignore.txt`), so it is never committed. A fresh clone has an empty `.developer` slot by construction; the first `init` writes it. Subsequent same-machine re-inits see the file and no-op.

**Consequence (accepted)**: Same developer on two machines (laptop A + laptop B) gets a joiner task on laptop B. This is fine — it's a chance to re-read the spec, and archiving is one command.

**Anti-pattern**: Do not use `.trellis/workspace/<name>/` existence as "this developer already onboarded" — that directory is the journal archive and belongs to git.

### Gotcha: Joiner Dispatch Must Be Wired in Two Places

`trellis init` has two code paths that both reach the end of initialization but through different branches of `init()`. Any new init-time trigger (joiner onboarding, future first-session tasks, etc.) must be registered in **both**:

**Path 1 — Main dispatch** (`src/commands/init.ts`, near the end of `init()`):

- Reached only when `!isFirstInit` is false **OR** `options.force` / `options.skipExisting` is set
- Fires from the block that runs after `createWorkflowStructure` + `init_developer.py`

**Path 2 — Re-init fast path** (`handleReinit`, inside `doAddDeveloper` branch):

- Reached when `.trellis/` already exists AND user runs default `trellis init --user <name>` (no `--force`, no `--skip-existing`)
- `init()` short-circuits via `if (!isFirstInit && !options.force && !options.skipExisting) { await handleReinit(...); return; }` — main dispatch is **never executed**

Both paths must capture the pre-existing `.developer` state **before** running `init_developer.py` (which writes the file), then use that snapshot to decide whether joiner generation applies.

```typescript
// Path 1 (init end) — snapshot at init() start
const hadDeveloperFileAtStart = fs.existsSync(developerFilePath);
// ... later, after init_developer.py:
if (!isFirstInit && !hadDeveloperFileAtStart) {
  createJoinerOnboardingTask(cwd, developerName);
}

// Path 2 (handleReinit) — snapshot just before init_developer.py
const hadDeveloperFileBefore = fs.existsSync(developerFilePath);
execSync(`${pythonCmd} ${initDeveloperScript} "${devName}"`, { ... });
if (!hadDeveloperFileBefore) {
  createJoinerOnboardingTask(cwd, devName);
}
```

**Test coverage requirement**: integration tests must cover BOTH paths. The quick way to detect regressions is to run `init` without `force: true` and assert joiner-task creation — tests that all pass `{ force: true }` will miss Path 2 bugs entirely.

## Common Mistakes

### Forgot to add entry to PLATFORM_FUNCTIONS

**Symptom**: `trellis init` configures the platform, but `trellis update` doesn't track its template files — and `getConfiguredPlatforms` never detects the platform, so it is invisible to update entirely.

**Cause**: `collectTemplates` is optional on `PlatformFunctions`, so a registry entry that omits it compiles and fails silently.

**Fix**: Register with `{platform}: fromTemplates(collect{Platform}Templates)` in `src/configurators/index.ts`. That form cannot omit `collectTemplates` — it *is* `collectTemplates`.

### Wrong command format in templates

**Symptom**: Slash commands don't work or show wrong format.

**Fix**: Check platform's command format and update all command references in templates.

### Codex template copied from project `.agents/skills` instead of `src/templates`

**Symptom**: Generated templates accidentally include repo-specific customizations and drift from template source-of-truth.

**Fix**: Always use `src/templates/{platform}/...` as source templates for `init/update`. Do not copy from project runtime directories.

### EXCLUDE_PATTERNS missing `.js` in configurator

**Symptom**: In production builds (`dist/`), `trellis init` copies compiled `index.js` (and `.js.map`, `.d.ts`) into the user's config directory (e.g., `.codex/index.js`).

**Cause**: The configurator walks its template directory and its `EXCLUDE_PATTERNS` doesn't filter out `.js` files. In development (`src/`), only `.ts` files exist so the issue is invisible. In production, `tsc` compiles `index.ts` → `index.js` into `dist/templates/{platform}/` and the walk picks it up.

**Fix**: Ensure `EXCLUDE_PATTERNS` includes `.js`, `.js.map`, `.d.ts`, `.d.ts.map`. Only `claude.ts` walks a directory today and it holds its own list. A platform that ships real `.js` runtime code must keep `.js` out of its exclusions and drop only the build artifacts.

**Prevention**: Prefer not walking a directory at all. A configurator that enumerates its files explicitly (`codex.ts`) cannot pick up a build artifact, which is why it is the default shape. Walk only when the template tree is genuinely open-ended, and then copy the exclusion list from the existing walker.

### Missing CLI flag or InitOptions field

**Symptom**: `trellis init --{platform}` doesn't work.

**Fix**: Add `--{platform}` option in `src/cli/index.ts` and `{platform}?: boolean` in `InitOptions` in `src/commands/init.ts`. These are static declarations that cannot be derived from the registry.

### Template placeholder not resolved in collectTemplates

**Symptom**: `trellis update` auto-updates platform files on every run, even when nothing changed. The update summary shows hooks/settings as "changed".

**Cause**: `collect{Platform}Templates()` puts a raw template into the map without calling `resolvePlaceholders()`, so `{{PYTHON_CMD}}` survives into the written file and into the update comparison.

**Fix**: Call `resolvePlaceholders()` at the point the entry is added to the map, e.g. `files.set(".codex/hooks.json", resolvePlaceholders(getHooksConfig()))`. Because the map is now the single description, the placeholder resolves identically on both paths by construction — there is no second site to keep in sync.

Note this is *only* about `{{…}}` placeholders. The separate `python3` → `python` literal rewrite is applied centrally by `renderTemplateMap` on both paths, so that half of this bug class is structurally closed.

### Init-time settings.json key injection serialized differently from update's preservation

**Symptom**: On a freshly initialized project that used an opt-in feature (e.g., `--with-statusline`), the very first `trellis update` reports `.claude/settings.json` as "Template updated (will auto-update)", rewrites it, and leaves a spurious backup — with zero actual changes.

**Cause**: Init injected the key at a hand-picked position in the template (e.g., `statusLine` "between `env` and `hooks`"), but update's preservation step (`preserveExistingClaudeStatusLine()` in `update.ts`) re-adds preserved keys via plain `parse → assign → stringify`, which appends at the end. The two serializations differ byte-wise, so the content comparison flags a false change.

**Fix**: The init-time injection must mirror the update-time preservation routine byte-for-byte (same parse → assign → stringify, same indent). Pinned by a regression test asserting `settings.json` byte-identity across `update --force` on a fresh opted-in project.

**Rule**: A feature that both (a) injects a key into a generated JSON file at init and (b) preserves that key during update must produce identical serialization on both paths — key order is part of the contract. Assert byte-identity (not deep-equality) in tests; deep-equal comparisons cannot catch key-order drift.

### Template listed in update but not created by init

**Symptom**: `trellis update` always detects a "new file" to add, even on a freshly initialized project with the same version.

**Cause**: `collectTemplateFiles()` in `update.ts` lists a file that `createSpecTemplates()` / `createWorkflowStructure()` in init never creates. The two template lists are out of sync.

**Fix**: Ensure every file listed in `collectTemplateFiles()` is actually created during `init`. If a file is project-specific (not a user template), do not include it in the update template list.

### Project-type-conditional content not gated in init or update

**Symptom**: Pure backend project gets empty frontend spec templates after `trellis init`. After user deletes the unwanted `spec/frontend/` dir, `trellis update` recreates it.

**Cause (init)**: `createSpecTemplates()` in `workflow.ts` received `projectType` but ignored it (parameter named `_projectType`). All project types got both backend and frontend spec dirs.

**Cause (update)**: `collectTemplateFiles()` in `update.ts` unconditionally included all 13 backend + frontend spec files in the template map, without checking whether `spec/backend/` or `spec/frontend/` actually existed on disk.

**Fix (init)**: Use `projectType` to conditionally create spec dirs:

- `"backend"` → guides + backend only
- `"frontend"` → guides + frontend only
- `"fullstack"` / `"unknown"` → guides + both

**Fix (update)**: Wrap backend/frontend spec file blocks in `fs.existsSync()` checks (same pattern as `getConfiguredPlatforms()` for platform dirs).

**Rule**: When init creates content conditionally based on project type, update must check for directory existence before including files in its template map. The two paths must agree.

### PRD assumed platform capabilities without research

**Symptom**: Implementation builds the wrong abstraction (e.g., commands instead of skills, or vice versa). Requires major rework after discovery.

**Cause**: PRD was written based on assumptions about how a platform works without verifying against official documentation or GitHub repos.

**Fix**: Before writing the PRD for a new platform, research the platform's actual extension mechanism:

- Check official docs for supported formats (skills, commands, rules, workflows)
- Check the platform's GitHub repo for directory structure conventions
- Verify how users invoke extensions (slash command, AI-automatic matching, manual mention)

**Prevention**: Add a "Research" step before PRD finalization. The PRD should cite sources for platform capability claims.

### Updated command/skill content in platform template instead of common/

**Symptom**: After updating a command in one platform's template, other platforms still use old content.

**Cause**: Since v0.5.0, command and skill content lives in `src/templates/common/` as the single source of truth. Editing platform-specific copies creates drift.

**Fix**: Always edit templates in `src/templates/common/commands/` or `src/templates/common/skills/`. All platforms derive their content from there via `resolveCommands()` / `resolveSkills()` / `resolveAllAsSkills()`.

### Stale platform references in copied templates

**Symptom**: A shared skill references "Claude Code" syntax or another platform-specific invocation pattern.

**Cause**: When creating agent templates for a new platform by copying from an existing one, platform-specific references (command syntax, platform names, invocation instructions) weren't updated.

**Fix**: After copying agent templates, search-and-replace all references to the source platform. Check for:

- Platform name mentions (e.g., "Claude Code", "Codex")
- Command invocation syntax (e.g., `/trellis:xxx` vs `$skill-name`)
- Config directory references (e.g., `.claude/` vs `.codex/`)

### Forgot to use shared hooks

**Symptom**: Platform's hooks directory contains duplicated Python scripts instead of the shared ones.

**Cause**: When adding a new agent-capable platform, developer copied hook scripts from another platform's template directory instead of calling `collectSharedHooks(hooksDir, platform)` from `shared.ts`.

**Fix**: Add the platform to `SHARED_HOOKS_BY_PLATFORM` with the hooks it can actually invoke, then use `collectSharedHooks()`. Only create platform-specific hook files when the platform has unique hook integration points (Codex bundles its own `session-start.py` for this reason).

**Prevention**: Declaring the platform in the table is only half the wiring — see "Declaring a shared hook is half the wiring" below.

### Hardcoded JSONL fallback paths

**Symptom**: Agent definitions reference JSONL files that don't exist (e.g., `debug.jsonl`, `plan.jsonl`).

**Cause**: Only `implement.jsonl` and `check.jsonl` exist as task JSONL files. Agent templates were copied from older versions that referenced removed JSONL types.

**Fix**: Ensure agent `.md` definitions only reference `implement.jsonl` and `check.jsonl`. The debug, plan, and dispatch agents have been removed.

### `__pycache__` in template hooks directory causes EISDIR crash

**Symptom**: Tests fail with `EISDIR: illegal operation on a directory, read` in `getAllHooks()` at `src/templates/claude/index.ts`.

**Cause**: Running a Python hook locally (e.g., `python3 session-start.py` for testing) creates `__pycache__/` inside `src/templates/{platform}/hooks/`. `listFiles("hooks")` returns `__pycache__` as an entry, then `readFileSync("hooks/__pycache__")` fails because it's a directory.

**Fix**: `rm -rf src/templates/*/hooks/__pycache__`. Consider adding `__pycache__` to `.gitignore` or filtering directories in `listFiles()`.

**Prevention**: Don't run Python hooks directly from `src/templates/` during development. Use `/tmp` copies or the installed project copy instead.

### Added an init-time trigger but forgot the `handleReinit` fast path

**Symptom**: The trigger works when users pass `--force` / `--skip-existing` / run init on an empty dir, but the default `trellis init --user <name>` on an existing checkout silently does nothing. Integration tests pass.

**Cause**: `init()` at `src/commands/init.ts` early-returns into `handleReinit` when `.trellis/` already exists and neither `--force` nor `--skip-existing` is set. Main dispatch at the end of `init()` is never reached. If the new trigger is only wired into main dispatch, the most common real-user path is uncovered.

**Fix**: Wire the trigger into BOTH (a) the main-dispatch block near the end of `init()` AND (b) `handleReinit`'s `doAddDeveloper` / `doAddPlatforms` branch, whichever is relevant. Capture any pre-init filesystem state (e.g., `.developer` existence) in each path separately, before scripts that mutate it run.

**Prevention**: Integration tests must cover the default path WITHOUT `force: true`. Any test using `force: true` bypasses `handleReinit` and is not testing real-user behavior. See "Bootstrap & Joiner Task Auto-Generation" above for the canonical two-point wiring pattern.
